# pastePasswordLists
Top password lists generated from leaks collected from different paste sites

## About
On paste sites like pastebin.com and ghostbin.co criminals and other actors publish and distribute leak data. Pentesters need lists of common used passwords, they can use in brute force attacks in their tests. These tests help to identify weak passwords which should be changed as they are widely known. This repository contains password lists assembled from leak data collected via different OSINT techniques. The lists are ranked by how often they were found on the mentioned paste site.

HINT: The lists have been anonymized, so they do not contain the account name where the password is or was used!

This is an ongoing project, so the lists may differe from time to time.
